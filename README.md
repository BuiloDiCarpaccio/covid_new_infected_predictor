# Covid-19 cases prediction Using Machine Learning

🦠 Last year, the world had been hit by a pandemic, that nobody was prepared for. The various measures taken by the differents governements have been ingenious, urgent and specific to each country, even if all was decided around a common base. One year after, it's time to check what was the best measures taken, and what we should do in the future, thanks to the data we got.
